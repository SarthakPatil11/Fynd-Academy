                    A laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook for short, is a small, portable
                    personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat panel screen (usually 11-17 
                    in or 280-430 mm in diagonal size) on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device 
                    (such as a trackpad and/or trackpoint) on the inside of the lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs with a detachable 
                    keyboard are often marketed as laptops or as having a "laptop mode". Most of the computer's internal hardware is 
                    fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, although many laptops have a built-in webcam at the top 
                    of the screen and some modern ones even feature a touch-screen display. In most cases, unlike table computers which 
                    run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems which have been traditionally 
                    associated with desktop computers.

                    A mobile phone (cellphone, etc.)[a] is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link
                    while the user is moving within a telephone service area, as opposed to a fixed-location phone (landline phone). The
                    radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access
                    to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture
                    and therefore mobile telephones are called cellphones (or "cell phones") in North America. In addition to telephony,
                    digital mobile phones support a variety of other services, such as text messaging, multimedia messagIng, email, Internet
                    access (via LTE, 5G NR or Wi-Fi), short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), satellite access
                    (navigation, messaging connectivity), business applications, video games and digital photography.

                    A tablet computer, commonly shortened to tablet, is a mobile device, typically with a mobile operating system and
                    touchscreen display processing circuitry, and a rechargeable battery in a single, thin and flat package. Tablets, being
                    computers, do what other personal computers do, but lack some input/output (I/O) abilities that others have. Modern
                    tablets largely resemble modern smartphones, the only differences being that tablets are relatively larger than
                    smartphones, with screens 7 inches (18 cm) or larger, measured diagonally,[1][2][3][4] and may not support access to a
                    cellular network. Unlike laptops (which have traditionally run off operating systems usually designed for desktops),
                    tablets usually run mobile operating systems, alongside smartphones.

                <p>
                    Wearable technology is any technology that is designed to be used while worn. Common types of wearable technology
                    include smartwatches and smartglasses. Wearable electronic devices are often close to or on the surface of the skin,
                    where they detect, analyze, and transmit information such as vital signs, and/or ambient data and which allow in some
                    cases immediate biofeedback to the wearer. Wearable devices such as activity trackers are an example of the Internet of Things, since "things" such as electronics,
                    software, sensors, and connectivity are effectors that enable objects to exchange data (including data quality[4])
                    through the internet with a manufacturer, operator, and/or other connected devices, without requiring human
                    intervention.

                    Headphones are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or around the head over a user's ears. They are
                    electroacoustic transducers, which convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound. Headphones let a single user
                    listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a loudspeaker, which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby
                    to hear. Headphones are also known as earphones[1] or, colloquially, cans.[2] Circumaural ('around the ear') and
                    supra-aural ('over the ear') headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the speakers in place. Another type,
                    known as earbuds or earpieces[1] consist of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal. A third type are bone
                    conduction headphones, which typically wrap around the back of the head and rest in front of the ear canal, leaving the
                    ear canal open. In the context of telecommunication, a headset is a combination of headphone and microphone.
